### Installing Python...or not
Get ready to run Python on your own!  To do this you will need a working Python installation that works with Jupyter notebooks.  If you are a science major I recommend you install it on your own computer.  If you don't wish to do so you are welcome to use one of the iMacs in the Obs Project Room.  If you choose the former option, here are two good choices.  Choose the one that best matches you.

1) Enthought Canopy.  This is what is used in CS 111 and also what’s on the Obs machines.  It is also what KKM uses, and the interface looks a lot like the Matlab that some of you might someday use elsewhere.  To install Canopy, go to the Enthought Academics page and follow the instructions.
    
2) Anaconda.  This is what’s used in lots of places including PHYS 202.  So if you're going to take PHYS 202, might as well install this now.  To install Anaconda, visit the Anaconda downloads page and follow the instructions.
